« Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that
"computer science" is not a science and that its significance has
little to do with computers.  The computer revolution is a revolution
in the way we think and in the way we express what we think.  The
essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called "procedural
epistemology"--the study of the structure of knowledge from an
imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of
view taken by classical mathematical subjects.  Mathematics provides a
framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is."  Computation
provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."»
